## REALITY AS DATA

**INTRODUCTION**

In the last 20 years it has arisen a more and more accepted theory proclaiming we are living  in a virtual world where our brain is creating and participating constnatly to this collective reality. We can imagine the brain as a biotechnological machine acting as a node of a series of interconnected nodes creating a global biocomputer mass with a consensus mechanism similar to the one of bitcoin.

We all agree we are seeing the same collective dream, and this agreement is implanted when we are born by inserting us a global OS by our mother - consensus algorythm. From there we grow up by adding applications and plugins to different parts of our personality for greater enjoyment of our Avatar in this game.

If we accept this simaultaion theory where we are living inside an infinite super computer which is driven by data, **DATA** become a fundamental piece to understand. Data, data types and data structures are at the core of any computer sciend way of understanding reality.

**Data objects as the fundamental of building blocks of reality**

When we feel reality through our 5 senses ( see-hear-smell-touch-taste-thought), this information can subdivided into smaller abstarct pieces:

* Things which can be counted - Quantitative data
* Things whicn can be named/categorized - Qualitative data

In fact this abstaction is made all the time and means different things for different people. Artists, musicians and scientists can see the world in different ways somtetimes. We can say we see the world through different Data Lenses. 
As an example let's see how these different characters see data in a different ways:

* When we see Reality through Math lens … what do we see? we see numbers-quantitative
* When we see Reality through DataScience lens… what do we see?we see qualitative and qualitative data expressed in percentages - statistics
* When we see Reality through the Computer science lens…what do we see?we see reality made of data structures we can manipulate and communicate/transfer with

For this reason it is very important to teach at an early age how to see the world through the DATA LENSES, how to see the world as DATA.

These lenses allow us to see reality in a way we can participate in the new technological revolution of the Internet, AI and Blockchain with much greater possibilities of success. If we can see the world is made of data, we can play and have fun in the world. And that’s what we want isn’t it?

I propose to create an introductory course for kids about DATA:
* A visual introduction to data: seeing the world through DATA LENSES 
    * What is data?
    * How data is seen by ( Math, DS, CS, Music, Artist )
    * Types of data - general / DS
    * Types of data - CS
    * Data structures - data objects
    * Examples of data objects and exercises ( Sliders of images and data - before/after )
    * How data transfer - send/receive - through the Internet - JSON
    * Examples of daily life - SLACK message - email - 
    * Defining and visualizing the news Lenses we use with some examples to end

Would be great to create a small course on that for early ages and HS students with different platforms

# Teaching about Data

When devloping content about data introduction and discovery it is important to remember the difference between data in:
* Data Science - Statistics - Probabilites - %
* Computer Science - Types - Structures - Objects
It is important to distinguish the fact that data playing a central role on both disciplines the one that is closes to KCJ is the Computer Science:
* Data types
* Data structures
* Internet - Data objects
