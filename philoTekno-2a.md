## TECHNOLOGY AS A SPEED VECTOR

When studying the field of philosophy of Technology we find two major currents:

* Philosophy of Science
* Philosophy of Technology

While historically Modern Sciences stems from the big questions classical philosophy formed, therefore always a deep relationship between both disciplins have existed.

In contrast the study of Technology from a Philosophical point of view not has been disconnected between both disciplines.

My opinion is that Technology is like a 'catalyst' or the human capacity to create systems allowing us to go faster in our quest for big questions - Philosphy, its responses - Science.

Meaning Science advances because of Technology. Tech is at the heart of any major invention. Tech is the practical, systematic and fast approach to get practical results to Philosophy and Science.

This advantage of flowing between both disciplines gives tech to tech position to flow, mold and prototype ideas. Tech is like the fast mental energy speeding up responses.

Because this 'time' factor, of speeding up things creates the feeling of going faster with consequences like great changes when applied properly. Tech is the WILL or the GREED to arrive home faster | outside but also there is Spiritual Tech which allow us to go faster inwards | Tantras.

## TEKNO and DESIRE/SUFFERING

From a spiritual point of view and taking as an inspiration buddhist philosophy we can say:
* TEKNO allow us to get FASTER what we DESIRE / WANT.
* TEKNO is not GOOD/BAD but a tool to achieve what we DESIRE/WANT
* TEKNO is not GOOB/BAD but the attachement to the OUTCOME

To support this last point, we can make a classic comparative with a Vipassana example of suffering and the cause of suffering.

When a drunk man drinks from the **bottle of wine** it is not addicted to the bottle of wine but to the effects of the wine/alcohol in its body. We are attached to the SENSATIONS not the tool in itself.

## SCIENCE vs TEKNO and DESIGN
* SCIENCE search is to understand the TRUTH
* TEKNO / ENGINEERING is **APPLIED SCIENCE**
* APPLIED SCIENCE creates **PRODUCTS/APPLICATIONS/SERVICES** to obtain/get things/stuff faster/easier

The implications of getting things faster/easier is:
* A rise in **COMPLEXITY** in the DESIGN process - Hidden with easy front-end
* A forced/engineered simplicity in the final product USABILITY/UX

SCIENCE and PHILOSOPHY have been always somehow connected becaues one come the other. Science from Philosophy.

TECHNOLOGY and PHILOSOPHY have been less in contact but nowadays with the society becoming a tehnological driven society Technology meets sociology - Social Engineering - and Philosophy through the creation of strong ethical frameworks for the first time. (aka AI)

## KCJ Notes
* IOT - MICROBIT
It's a physical engieneered product that can be the inspiration to create other engineered products based on top of it. It's the prefect tool to learn how to be a hardware/software engineer.
> You can learn 3 languages to program with it

* SCRATCH - PLATFORM
It's a software platform and language that allows us to create/program new games/adventuers/stories ( products) with the computer.
> You can lerarn 2 languages to program with it
