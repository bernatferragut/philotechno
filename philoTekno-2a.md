## TECHNOLOGY AS A SPEED VECTOR

When studying the field of philosophy of Technology we find two major currents:

* Philosophy of Science
* Philosophy of Technology

While historically Modern Sciences stems from the big questions classical philosophy formed, therefore always a deep relationship between both disciplins have existed.

In contrast the study of Technology from a Philosophical point of view not has been disconnected between both disciplines.

My opinion is that Technology is like a 'catalyst' or the human capacity to create systems allowing us to go faster in our quest for big questions - Philosphy, its responses - Science.

Meaning Science advances because of Technology. Tech is at the heart of any major invention. Tech is the practical, systematic and fast approach to get practical results to Philosophy and Science.

This advantage of flowing between both disciplines gives tech to tech position to flow, mold and prototype ideas. Tech is like the fast mental energy speeding up responses.

Because this 'time' factor, of speeding up things creates the feeling of going faster with consequences like great changes when applied properly. Tech is the WILL or the GREED to arrive home faster | outside but also there is Spiritual Tech which allow us to go faster inwards | Tantras.
