# PHILOSOPHY OF LEARNING
> [Eudcational Psychology](https://lumenlearning.com/courses/educational-psychology/) | EPISTEMOLOGY

## PHILOSOPHICAL TRADITIONS
* J.PIAGET - Educational Psychology - Constructivism - Objects and Cognitive Structures
* H.POINCARÃ‰ - Aesthetics and beauty on logical Mathematics
* S.PAPERT - Logo - Microworlds - Computer Communities


## OLD SCHOOL vs NEW SCHOOL
The Philosophical tradition of branch we feel we are part of has always been 'aware' of the limitations given by the classical systems we find in our school system. Therefore we place ourselves in a position of helping with new methods our children complement the weaknesses of the traditional school system following a set of ideas layed down mainly by the following philosophers, psychologists and scientists.

Traditional Schools put emphasis on :
* Repetition
* Disociation ( Math)
* Logic
* Quantification

[J.PIAGET - CONSTRUCTIVISM](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/educationalpsychology/chapter/cognitive-development-the-theory-of-jean-piaget/)
### The object as the 'story|link' to create cognitive structures | Accomodation and assimilation

* The sensorimotor stage: birth to age 2 
> _Stability : Object Permanence_
* The preoperational stage: age 2 to 7
> _Dramatic Play : When they invent real objects - Metacognition_
* The concrete operational stage: age 7 to 11
> _Mentally operates with concrete objects and events_
> _Reversibility_
> _Decenter_
> _Conservation_
* The formal operational stage: age 11 and beyond | Operate on forms and representations
> _Hypothetical reasoning_ Manipulate complex ideas in their minds | Many adults do not reach Formal Thinking
> _Teacher must be more on the ASKING questions to discover how to thinking works._
* [Constructivism](https://www.teach-nology.com/currenttrends/constructivism/piaget/)

[H.POINCARE - MATHEMATICS AND AESTHETICS](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9)
### How the Rational process works: Consciouss vs Unconsciouss
* Problem is solved through different phases:
> Formal thinking stage one - if difficult
> Leave it to Unconsciouss (apparnetly) - Hard work on the back through systematic computational processes
> Solution comes back (from nowhere) - The most aesthetical is chosen and given to formal consciouss thinking
> Beauty an aesthetics are as important as Rational / Logical in Mathematics and problem solving

[S.PAPERT - LOGO AND MICROWORLDS](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9)
### How the Rational process works: Consciouss vs Unconsciouss
* Logo: A Language to learn about Thinking ( Math | Physics ... etc )
* Creation of an _Experimental environment_ to Learn previous to given Theory ( Buffer to learn )
* Programming allows to 'visualize' your thinking 
* Play with objects and create new ones
* _Modularizes thinking_ - Which is shared with computers and Humans
* Gives order and structure to formal thinking
* Creation of Microworlds with just what is needed to learn about specific subjects
* Thinking is more like a 'Bricolage' where experimentation gives place to cognitive connections
* Allows to use simple euristic rules - Computational Thinking - to solve complex problems:
1._Is too complex? Subdivide it_
2._Is there something similar to it? Try it_ 
3._Modularize your thinking to solve the problem_
* Opens the possibility of AI being possible to HI - Different but Similar - Bird vs Airplane ( both follow bernoulliy theorem - AI and HI follow Modularization - As similar ways of thinking)
* The importance of _Learning Environments_ - Samba Schools - Culture + Common Goal as Learning Environment
* Similart to Catalan Castellers as - Culture + Common Goal to create Successful enviromnemnts


## FUTURE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS
* Computer Worlds
* Interconnected Internet Worlds
* Blockchain Decentralized Autonomous Organizations - DAO's
* Example - [Aragon](https://aragon.org/learn)
> Common Goal - Gain
> Inner Economy
> Self Governance
> Social sharing of ideas
> Code as the common language transporting powerful ideas.
